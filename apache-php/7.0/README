Because the build now requires a private github repo a passwordless ssh key is
required for the build.  It can be done like so:

docker build --build-arg SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_auto)" \
  -t pica9/php-base:7.0.4 .

where pica9/php-base:7.0.4 is the docker tag and ~/.ssh/id_auto is the
aforementioned ssh key.  See also the Dockerfile in this dir.
